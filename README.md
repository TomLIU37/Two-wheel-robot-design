# Two-wheel-robot-design
Hi everyone,

I decide to  contribute my evening in the future to realize this project, which is, after a carefully condiderarion, something that I really want to do. Like the old saying says, interest is the best teacher. And I do believe, that we lived in an era that will change epidamically in a few years, and robots, will play an unexpected role in our live.

That is the motivation to create this project.

This project includes mainly 3 parts: robot design, manufacture, and control algorithm design.

Now we are still in the first phase.
